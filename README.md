# IMGCB
This is a course project of Signals and Systems. We have tried to get some knowledge about compression and blurring. The techniques used for compression are DCT, DWT and chroma subsampling. We have also implemented blurring of images in Time and Frequency domain to show difference in computation time. More details about the project can be found in project report and PPT.
